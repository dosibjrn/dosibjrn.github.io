## Introduction

Calora is an app designed to assist users in tracking their dietary intake. This privacy policy outlines our commitment to privacy and the handling of information within our app.

## Data Handling and Third-Party Services

Calora utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4v technology for AI-based nutritional estimates from meal photos. The methodology relies on advanced machine learning algorithms to provide educated guesses about food content. These estimates are intended for informational purposes only and are not for medical use.

Calora writes nutritional information to Apple HealthKit at your request but does not access, read, or store any data from Apple HealthKit within the app. This integration complies with Apple's privacy standards and policies.
